# Getting Started with Quran Medina App

I love the old Medina Quran very much that I decided to make a web app of it.
I started by downloading old Quran Medina pdf and then use some script to automatically convert that pdf to png images.
After that, I created this simple react app that display those png images side by side.
I hope you like it and benefit from it.

This is a screen capture of the app:

And this is the demo link: [https://mushaf-azifu.web.app/?page=317](https://mushaf-azifu.web.app/?page=317)

You can use:
 - **left arrow** to go to next page; and conversely, 
 - **right arrow** to go to previous page.

Surah List link is also available on the top right corner
